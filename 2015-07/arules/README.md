## Full Execution of the Example

### Required Packages:
**readr, dplyr, tidyr, arules, arulesViz**

1. Clone the repo to a local folder
2. Open and execute User_AA_Arules.Rmd
3. Data will be downloaded to the ./Data folder
    - This may take a couple minutes, especially the first time
4. The expensive steps of the markdown file are cached
    - Delete the User_AA_Arules_cache file to fully re-run

### Notes

Most of the code to run the example is stored in:

- 1_DataPrep
- 2_RuleGen
