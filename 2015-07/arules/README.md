# Full Execution of the Example

## Required Packages:
readr, dplyr, tidyr, arules, arulesViz

1. Clone the repo to a local folder
2. Open and execute User_AA_Arules.Rmd
3. Data will be downloaded to the ./Data folder
    - This may take a couple minutes, especially the first time
4. The expensive steps of the markdown file are cached
    - Delete the User_AA_Arules_cache file to fully re-run
