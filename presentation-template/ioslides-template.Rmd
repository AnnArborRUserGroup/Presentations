## About Me
- What do you do?
- What's your experience with R?
- What's your experience with the topic?

## What to Expect
 - tell the audience a little bit about what you'll cover
 - it doesn't need to a be a detailed outline; those are usually boring anyways
 - notice how these display one-at-a-time?
 - set `incremental: no` in the YAML header to render all bullets at once

# Look, a New Section!

## What about code?
The great thing about RMarkdown is including code which will be ran when this document is knit.

You can have inline code, like tomorrow's date is `r Sys.Date()+1`, or blocks of code ("code chunks") like

```{r}
today    <- Sys.Date()
tomorrow <- today + 1
print(tomorrow)
```

See how it displays the code and the results? You can add chunk arguments (next to the `r` in brackets) to do many things, like hide the code or output, set figure dimensions, cache results, etc.

## Links
You can create a link to a website like [this](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations).

Image links are very similar, you just need to have the image in the same location as this file: ![R](R.jpg)

## More options {.build}
Notice the `{.build}` next to the slide title; this acts like the `incremental: yes` header option, but applies to non-bulleted lines as well, like this one.

That's why this line wasn't diplayed right away.

- the downside of .build is it makes you double-click for bullets
- which is kind of annoying sometimes

- It's a good idea to have a similar section in your presentation
