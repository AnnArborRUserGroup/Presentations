a groan of tedium escapes me startling the fearful is this a test it has to be otherwise i cant go on draining patience drain vitality this paranoid paralyzed vampire acts a little old but im still right here giving blood keeping faith and im still right here but im still right here giving blood keeping faith and im still right here if there were no rewards to reap no loving embrace to see me through

i know the pieces fit cause i watched them fall away mildewed and smouldering fundamental differing pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion disintegrating as it goes testing our communication the light that feuled our fire then has a burned a hole between us so we cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication  i know the pieces fit cause i watched them tumble down no fault none to blame it doesnt mean i dont desire to point the finger blame the other     
so familiar and overwhelmingly warm this one this form i hold now embracing you this reality here this one this form i hold now so wide eyed and hopeful wide eyed and hopefully wild      
so familiar and overwhelmingly warm this one this form i hold now embracing you this reality here this one this form i hold now so wide eyed and hopeful wide eyed and hopefully wild  we barely remember what came before this precious moment choosing to be here right now hold on stay inside this body holding me reminding me that i am not alone in this body makes me feel eternal all this pain is an illusion      
suck and suck suckin up all you can suckin up all you can suck workin up under my patience like a little tick fat little parasite suck me dry my blood is bruised and borrowed you thieving bastards you have turned my blood cold and bitter beat my compassion black and blue hope this is what you wanted
