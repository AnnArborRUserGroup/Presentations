## About Me
- Data Science and Software Engineering at Seelio
- Have worked with R for nearly a decade
- Use Docker extensively at Seelio

## What to Expect
- What is Docker?
- Docker architecture
- Key components
- Images, containers, networks, and volumes
- Example: Launching your first Docker container
- Example: Running R within a Docker container
- Example: Building your own custom image
- Example: Using Docker Compose

## Software Versions Used
- Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11.3)
- Docker Engine 1.10.2
- Docker Compose 1.6.2 (must use at least `docker-compose` 1.6.0 to support
the version 2 format of `docker-compose.yml`)
- Docker Machine 0.6.0


# Docker Concepts

## What is Docker?
From https://www.docker.com/what-docker:

```
Docker containers wrap up a piece of software in a complete filesystem that
contains everything it needs to run: code, runtime, system tools, system
libraries â€“ anything you can install on a server. This guarantees that it will
always run the same, regardless of the environment it is running in.
```

- Docker daemon uses Linux-specific kernel features, which means containers only
run on Linux
- Docker daemon is run on Mac OS X and Windows via a Linux VM
- Best practice is to have one application/service per container

<div class="notes">
Docker containers are self-contained pieces of software. Ties well to 
microservices and you would typically have one service per container.
Docker containers are lightweight and isolated.
Segue: Docker let's us run software within containers.  Why is that helpful?
</div>

## Why Use Containers?
- Same arguments as one would use for microservices: encourages you to compose
functional units of software to create your final product
- Consistent environment (package application with its configuration and
dependencies together)
- Secure (containers isolated from one another)
- Lightweight (containers share same operating system kernel)
- Scalable (if you make your services stateless, can easily scale up/down as
needed)
- Shareable (as you generate releases, push tagged
images to your image repository on Docker Hub)
- Develop in an environment that mimics your production environment as closely
as possible

<div class="notes">
- Segue: This sounds kinda like a VM.  How is it different?
</div>

## How is Docker Different From a VM?
- VMs also create an isolated environment; what makes containers different?
- Containers have similar resource isolation and allocation benefits as virtual
machines but a different architectural approach allows them to be much more
portable and efficient:

  <img src="https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/what-is-vm-diagram.png" width="300">
</div>

<div class="notes">
- Containers: faster startup, more efficient resource consumption
- VM: Each virtual machine includes the application, the necessary binaries and
libraries and an entire guest operating system - all of which may be tens of GBs
in size.
- Container: Containers include the application and all of its dependencies, but
share the kernel with other containers.
- Segue: Let's review the high-leve architecture of Docker
</div>

## Docker Architecture
![Architecture](https://docs.docker.com/engine/article-img/architecture.svg)

<div class="notes">
- Client: primary user interface to Docker.  Communicates on the users behalf
with the Docker daemon
- Docker Host and Docker daemon: the Docker daemon manages images and creation
of containers
- Docker registry: for storage of images
- Segue: brief aside on Docker Host on Windows and OS X
</div>

## Docker Architecture
- Docker Host is a VM on Windows and Mac OS X:

<div class="columns-2">
  <img src="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/images/linux_docker_host.svg" width="300">
  <img src="https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/images/mac_docker_host.svg" width="300">
</div>

<div class="notes">
What runs inside a Docker container is a UNIX process.  To be able to run Docker
on Windows and Mac OS X, you need to run a Linux VM. However, you only run one
VM in which all of your containers run versus running a new VM for each
application
- Segue: Let's know cover the main components of Docker and what they do
</div>

## Key Components
- **Docker Machine** (`docker-machine`): used on Windows and Mac OS X to manage the
Linux VM on which the Docker daemon runs, or to create a Docker swarm
- **Docker Engine** (`docker`): the combination of the client with which you
communicate with other parts of the Docker architecture as well as the daemon
that receives commands from the client and manages containers
- **Docker Hub**: public Docker registry in which built images can be stored
- **Docker Compose** (`docker-compose`): tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications (Compose not yet supported on Windows)
- **Docker Swarm**: Docker Swarm is native clustering for Docker. It turns a pool of
Docker hosts into a single, virtual Docker host. Outside the scope of this talk

*In a development environment, the docker client and docker daemon will usually
run on the same physical system.  However, this need not be true.*

<div class="notes">
- Segue: let's review how these components relate to the high-level architecture
</div>

## Docker Architecture
![Architecture](https://docs.docker.com/engine/article-img/architecture.svg)

<div class="notes">
- Tie back to components discussed on previous slide
- Seque to discussion of images and containers
</div>

## Images and Containers
<div class="centered">
![](https://www.docker.com/sites/default/files/products/what_is_layered_filesystems_sm.png)
</div>
- Docker uses a layered filesystem. Layers are combined to form a unified
filesystem; later layers hide the content of earlier layers at the same path
- Images are pre-built, read-only templates that are used to create containers
- Containers add a read-write layer to the filesystem
- A Docker container holds everything that is needed for an application to run

<div class="notes">
- Each image starts with a base image (the FROM statement in the Dockerfile)
- Additional layers are added via subsequent statements (RUN, ENV, etc.) in
the Dockerfile
- Docker defines a build as running a sequence of Unix commands, one after the
other, in the same container.
</div>

## Networks and Volumes
- For different containers to be able to communicate with one another, they
must be on the same Docker network
- You create a network either via the network directive within your
`docker-compose.yml` file or via the `docker network create` command
- Volumes are used to store data
- You create a volume either via the volumes directive within your
`docker-compose.yml` file or via the `docker volume create` command

<div class="notes">
- Docker Compose 1.6.0 introduced new networking capabilities
- You can also mount a local directory into the container.  The volumes
referred to here are persistent volumes that are shareable across containers.
</div>

# Applying Docker

## VM Setup for Windows and Mac
Assumes Docker Engine and Docker Machine have already been installed

1. Create the virtual machine:
    + `docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default`
    + On my Mac, I also found that adding `--engine-storage-driver overlay`
    to the above `docker-machine create` command worked better
2. Configure your local environment to be able to communicate with the Docker
Host:
    + `eval $(docker-machine env)`
3. (optional) Verify that your setup is working properly
    + `docker run hello-world`


## Demo Setup
Steps that I carried out in advance (for the sake of time):

- `docker pull debian`
- `docker pull postgres`
- `docker pull r-base`
- `docker pull rocker/hadleyverse`
- Created a sample dataset to import to Postgres to use in the examples
  (available in the [AARUG Github repo](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/tree/master/2016-03/blake-docker-and-R))
- Created an R script that simply prints "hello world" (available in the [AARUG Github repo](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/tree/master/2016-03/blake-docker-and-R/hello.R))

Images pulled the morning of March 10, 2016

<div class="notes">
- sample data from https://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/A191RL1Q225SBEA/downloaddata
</div>

## Example: Launching your first Docker container
`docker run -it --rm debian bash`

1. Downloads the latest debian Docker image
2. Creates a container
3. Allocates a filesystem and mounts a read-write layer
4. Allocates a network interface
5. Sets up an IP address
6. Runs your command (in this case `bash`)

## Example: Running R within a Docker container
`docker run -it --rm r-base`

- r-base image available on Docker Hub
- Maintained by Carl Boettiger and Dirk Eddelbuettel (Rcpp)
- r-base includes base R and littler, and is primarily intended as a starting
point for other images that include additional libraries and packages

Details about `r-base` package can be found
[on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/r-base/)

<div class="notes">
- Call attention to fact we were dropped directly into R and did not have to
kick off R from command line.  This is because R is the CMD value for the r-base
image.  Only have to specify a command to `docker run` if you want to do
something different.
- Execute `library()` from within R to show installed packages
</div>

## Example: Running R within a Docker container
`docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd)":/home/docker -w /home/docker -u docker r-base bash`

- The command above will put you in a bash shell in the Docker container with
your local directory available at /home/docker within the container
- You can run `R` from the command line (use R interactively or batch)
- Instead of specifying `bash` as the command to `docker run`, you could run R
directly: `R CMD ...`
- Can also leverage littler to run scripts instead (e.g., 'r hello.R')

<div class="notes">
- Mention how the volume mounted via the -v argument is different from the
volumes mentioned earlier in the presentation
- Make sure people are clear on the fact we can edit the files locally on our
host, and the updates will be reflected within the Docker container
- Segue: r-base has basic R functionality, but there are lots of packages in
the ecosystem that we're likely going to want to leverage...enter the rocker
project
</div>

## Example: Running R within a Docker container
Other R images available:

- **rocker/shiny**: r-base plus Shiny Server
- **rocker/r-devel**: r-base plus R-devel
- **rocker/rstudio**: r-base plus RStudio Server
- **rocker/hadleyverse**: rstudio plus Hadley packages and LaTeX
- **rocker/rOpenSci**: hadleyverse plus rOpenSci packages

Links to the rocker Github and Docker Hub accounts can be found in the
Resources section at the end of the presentation

<div class="notes">
- In honor of Clayton's love for the Hadleyverse, we'll use that image as a
base from which we create a new image
</div>

## Example: Building your own custom image
[Example Dockerfile](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/tree/master/2016-03/blake-docker-and-R/Dockerfile):
```
# Builds image upon the existing rocker/hadleyverse image
FROM rocker/hadleyverse

# Example of installing a library
RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        libpqxx-dev \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/ \
    && rm -rf /tmp/downloaded_packages/ /tmp/*.rds

# Example of installing additional R packages
RUN install2.r --error \
    -r "https://cran.rstudio.com" \
    RCurl
```

<div class="notes">
- Starts with the rocker/hadleyverse image
- Adds a layer that installs the Postgres C++ library and headers
- Adds a layer that installs the RCurl package from CRAN
</div>

## Example: Building your own custom image
Building your image: `docker build -t <name>:<tag> .`

Assumes `Dockerfile` resides in the current directory

Push image to Docker Hub via `docker push` (beyond the scope of this talk,
see `docker push --help` for more info)

<div class="notes">
- Set <name> = aarug and <tag> = latest when building image so future examples
work properly
</div>

## Example: Docker Compose
[Example docker-compose.yml available on Github](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations/tree/master/2016-03/blake-docker-and-R/docker-compose.yml)

1. Execute `docker-compose up -d` from the diretory in which
`docker-compose.yml` resides
2. Populate the Postgres database service by running `populate_postgres.sh`
script uploaded to Github as part of this presentation
3. Launch your web browser
4. Execute `docker-machine ip` to find out the IP address of your Docker host
(only needed on Mac and Windows, can just use localhost on Linux)
5. Navigate to http://docker_host, where you replace docker_host with hostname
from previous step
6. Enter rstudio/rstudio for user/pass to login to RStudio
7. Check out all the goodness!

To shut down services, execute `docker-compose down`

<div class="notes">
To execute from within RStudio:

- library()
- library(RPostgreSQL)
- library(ggplot2)
- drv <- dbDriver("PostgreSQL")
- con <- dbConnect(drv, user="aarug", password="risfun", host="postgres", dbname="aarug")
- df <- dbGetQuery(con, "select * from gdp")
- qplot(ds, value, data=df, geom="line")

</div>
