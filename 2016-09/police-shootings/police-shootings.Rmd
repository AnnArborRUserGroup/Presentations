## About Me
- What do you do?
- What's your experience with R?
- What's your experience with the topic?

## What to Expect
 - tell the audience a little bit about what you'll cover
 - it doesn't need to a be a detailed outline; those are usually boring anyways
 - notice how these display one-at-a-time?
 - set `incremental: no` in the YAML header to render all bullets at once

# Background

## The Problem
<img src="Picture2.png" style="float:right;" width=125px>
<img src="Picture1.png" style="float:right;" width=400px>
The US has recently witnessed a number of high-profile deaths of African-Americans at the hands of police.

> - Michael Brown
> - Eric Garner
> - Walter Scott

There is a pressing need to study this phenomenon quantitatively. Why?

> - Case reports are insufficient and could even be misleading
> - Better understand the causes
> - Help shape solutions

## An Important Step Forward

A Multi-Level Bayesian Analysis of Racial Bias in Police Shootings at the County-Level in the United States, 2011-2014
Cody T. Ross*

US Police-Shooting Database (USPSD)

- crowd-sourced database
- covers years 2011-2014
- n=721

##Ross' Two Step Modeling Strategy

- For each county i, let Ci be the ratio of:
probability of unarmed person being killed by police given black
----------------------------------------------------
probability of unarmed person being killed by police given white
 
- Step 1: Use Bayesian methods to estimate the Ci's
- Step 2: Use Bayesian methods to examine the effects of county-level covariates in accounting for variance in the Ci's
 
Ross, C. T. (2015). A Multi-Level Bayesian Analysis of Racial Bias in Police Shootings at the County-Level in the United States, 2011-2014. PLoS ONE, 10(11), e0141854-34

## Key Results
1 Unarmed blacks are 3.49 times as likely to be shot by police compared to unarmed whites
2 There is substantial variation in the county-level risk ratios
- Miami-Dade 22.88, Los Angeles 10.25, New Orleans 9.29
3 County-level risk ratios are not related to county-level race-specific crime rates
- This finding is particularly important because blacks are overrepresented in violent crime. One might otherwise use this observation to explain away elevated risk ratios
  
## Our Work builds on Ross (2015) in two ways
1 We use a newly available Washington Post database
- likely more comprehensive
- spans 2015-present
2 We adopt a different modeling framework, while retaining the spirit of Ross's Bayesian methods

## Our main questions
1 Are Ross's main results replicated in WashPo database?
- black/white racial disparity, large spatial variation, disparity unaccounted for by crime rates
2 Is there temporal stability in spatial variation in risk ratios?
- in other words, will Miami-Dade, Los Angeles, and New Orleans (and other counties with elevated risk) tend to still have higher risk ratios in the WashPo database?
  

## What about code?
The great thing about RMarkdown is including code which will be ran when this document is knit.

You can have inline code, like tomorrow's date is `r Sys.Date()+1`, or blocks of code ("code chunks") like

```{r}
today    <- Sys.Date()
tomorrow <- today + 1
print(tomorrow)
```

See how it displays the code and the results? You can add chunk arguments (next to the `r` in brackets) to do many things, like hide the code or output, set figure dimensions, cache results, etc.

## Links
You can create a link to a website like [this](https://github.com/AnnArborRUserGroup/Presentations).

Image links are very similar, you just need to have the image in the same location as this file: ![R](R.jpg)

## More options {.build}
Notice the `{.build}` next to the slide title; this acts like the `incremental: yes` header option, but applies to non-bulleted lines as well, like this one.

That's why this line wasn't diplayed right away.

- the downside of .build is it makes you double-click for bullets
- which is kind of annoying sometimes

- It's a good idea to have a similar section in your presentation
