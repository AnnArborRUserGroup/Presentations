# Presentations

This is the official repository for [Ann Arbor R User Group](http://www.meetup.com/Ann-Arbor-R-User-Group/) presentations.

## Organization

Each meetup has its own directory named like `yyyy-mm`, e.g. `2015-01`. Within that, each presentation should have its own directory.

## Presentation Format

The preferred presentation format is an R Markdown document, though presenters can bring in additional material. For any materials that can't be reached from an arbitrary web browser, you should coordinate with the meetup host to make sure they can accomodate you.

You can find out more about creating R Markdown files [here](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).

## Instructions for new presenters

First time presenters should message an organizer to be added to the github organization. Clone the directory for the meetup you will be presenting at (e.g. `2015-03-12`). Create a new directory and add your content, including code, data, and output. Initiate a pull request when you have finished your presentation.
