## Overview

- Background on the development of super learner and targeted learning
- Theory behind the super learner algorithm
- Application of super learner in R
- Some (hopefully) helpful comments on utilizing super learner

## Background

<div class="centered">
"Essentially, all models are wrong, but some are useful" - George Box, 1979

</div>

- Mantra of statisticians regarding the development of statistical models for many years
- In the 1990s an awareness developed among statisticians (Breiman, Harrell) that this lackadaisical approach was wrong
- Simultaneously, computer scientists and some statisticians developed the machine learning field to address the limitations of parametric models

## Targeted learning
- Combines advanced machine learning with efficient semiparametric estimation to provide a framework for answering causal questions from data
- Developed by Mark van der Laan research group at UC Berkeley
- Started with the seminal 2006 article on targeted maximum likelihood estimation
